## File Structure

- `stats.c`: Contains the implementation of the statistical functions.
- `stats.h`: Header file with function prototypes and comments.
- `main.c`: Main program file with a sample array for testing.

## Functions

1. `main()`: The main entry point for the program.

2. `print_statistics()`: A function that prints the statistics of an array, including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.

3. `print_array()`: Given an array of data and its length, this function prints the array to the screen.

4. `find_median()`: Given an array of data and its length, this function returns the median value.

5. `find_mean()`: Given an array of data and its length, this function returns the mean.

6. `find_maximum()`: Given an array of data and its length, this function returns the maximum value.

7. `find_minimum()`: Given an array of data and its length, this function returns the minimum value.

8. `sort_array()`: Given an array of data and its length, this function sorts the array in descending order, where the zeroth element is the largest value, and the last element (n-1) is the smallest value.
